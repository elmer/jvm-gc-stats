JVM-GC-STATS


SUMMARY
A Ruby script to parse the output from the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) garbage collection trace output, push the data into Ganglia
and alert on anomolies. The data and graphs produced are intended
to support operational monitoring of production processes and for
to also inform GC tuning decisions.

The JVM is assumed to be Java6 and invoked with the following flags:
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -verbosegc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps

Currently this script is a rough prototype written by a Ruby neophyte
in a rush to get data. Be gentle.
