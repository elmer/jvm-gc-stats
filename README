JVM-GC-STATS
============

SUMMARY
-------
A Ruby script to parse Java Virtual Machine (JVM) garbage collection
trace output, push the data into Ganglia and alert on anomolies.
The data and graphs produced are intended to support operational
monitoring and inform GC tuning decisions.

The JVM is assumed to be Java6 and invoked with the following flags:
	-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
	-verbosegc
	-XX:+PrintGCDetails
	-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
	-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps

Currently this script is a rough prototype written by a Ruby neophyte
in a rush to get data. Be gentle.
